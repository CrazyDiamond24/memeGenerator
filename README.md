## Known Issues

Please note that there are some known issues with this application that you may encounter while using it. While these issues may impact the functionality of the editor, the app is still usable.

- Changing the font may not always work as expected
- Text may be duplicated when changing the font size

Unfortunately, I am no longer actively working on this project as I have moved on to other projects. As such, these issues may not be addressed in the foreseeable future. However, I welcome any contributions from the community to help improve the app.
